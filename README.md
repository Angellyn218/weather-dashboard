# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Checking the weather has become an important part of many people's daily routine. If a potential user wants to check the weather for a specific city, they can use this weather dashboard website. This website can be used to help its users check the weather in the city of their choosing. In addition, the previously searched cities will be placed in the sidebar and their locally stored data will be displayed on the screen when the button with the corresponding city name is pushed.

Through building this project, I learned to better use APIs. Specifically, I used OpenWeatherMap's Weather API. This project gave me a better understanding of how to add in the correct query parameters in order to get the desired data. I have no doubt that this skill will be very useful in the future, so I am grateful that I learned it.

To use this website, type in a valid city name. (If the city does not exist, the website will not show anything).
Press the search button.

This will bring up the data for the city and a button with the city name. If this button with a city name is pressed, the data saved data will repopulate the screen.

Previously searched cities will have corresponding buttons that will be displayed on the page when it initially loads.
